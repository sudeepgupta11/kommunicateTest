I have used the following appraoch to solve the problem

1. Take input as a String for start dates, end dates and movie names in 3 seperate lines.
2. Using split function, convert the data into an array.
3. Use a class to store the data
4. Create a list(movieList) of type Movie Class and store all data in that list.
5. Sort the list(movieList) based on the end date by overriding the compareTo function.
6. Create a list(moviesToDo) of type Movie Class for storing the result.
7. Intially, add the first movie in the result list.
8. Now, loop through all the movies and add the movies whose start date is greater than the last choosen movie(last movie that was added in moviesToDo List).
9. We will get the list of movie that the actor should work in, to generate maximum profits.
